Create 2 .txt files, one should contain all the senders and the other one should contain all receivers.

Format of the senders file should be:
mail@gmail.com password
mail2@gmail.com password...

Format of the receivers file should be:
mail@gmail.com
mail2@gmail.com...

Password for senders should be obtained by enabling 2FA in Google Account Settings -> Security and then adding an Application Password on that same page.
